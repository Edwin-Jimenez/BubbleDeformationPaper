	abstract = {New results are reported on the simulation of the rise of a deforming gas bubble surrounded by a liquid exhibiting a blend of shear-thinning and viscoelastic properties. A new hybrid model has been developed which combines the Carreau model for emulating the shear-thinning property of the liquid with the Chilcott--Rallison (FENE-CR) model for treating the viscoelastic property of the liquid. The new hybrid model allows one to independently prescribe the shear-thinning and viscoelastic properties (parameters) to be used in a simulation. Computations are implemented using the coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method for tracking the deforming gas-liquid interface. The interfacial jump conditions are enforced with the sharp interface approach. In this study, four parameters, the E{\"o}tv{\"o}s number, Carreau model parameter for slope of decreasing viscosity, Deborah number, and viscoelastic polymer dumbbell length parameter, are varied in order to gain understanding for gas bubble morphology in liquids exhibiting both shear-thinning and viscoelastic properties. It is found that the extent of bubble deformation and the liquid stress field are strongly dependent on these 4 parameters with minimal correlation between the shear-thinning and viscoelastic parameters. The ability to vary shear-thinning and viscoelastic parameters independently of one another in the new hybrid Carreau and FENE-CR model enables one to conveniently predict gas bubble behavior in complex liquid polymers by parameterizing the new model from basic measurements of the polymers.},

	abstract = {{The buoyancy-driven motion of a single skirted bubble or drop rising through a viscous liquid is computationally explored by way of 3d-axisymmetric computations. The Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible two-fluid flow are solved numerically in which the coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid method is used to simulate the deforming bubble/drop boundary and the interface jump conditions on the deforming boundary are enforced through a sharp interface numerical treatment. Dynamic, block structured adaptive grid refinement is employed in order to sufficiently resolve the thin skirts. Results on the sensitivity of the thickness of trailing bubble/drop skirts to the density ratio and viscosity ratio are reported. It is shown that both the density ratio (not the density difference) and the viscosity ratio effect the skirt thickness. Previous theory for predicting skirt thickness can be refined as a result of our calculations. It is also discovered that the formation of thin skirts for bubbles and drops have little effect on the rise velocity. In other words, the measured Re number for cases without skirt formation have almost the same values for Re as cases with a thin skirt.}},

Numerical simulations of single bubble deformation are qualitatively compared with experimental results in a shear flow. Respectively the rotation angle θ is quantitatively compared with experimental results according to different capillary numbers (Ca), which shows numerical simulations are in agreement with the experimental results and theoretical results. Finally, the breakup process of single bubble in a shear flow is simulated straightforwardly. },

	abstract = {We present measurements of shape and orientation of air bubbles in a viscous Newtonian fluid deformed by simple shear. The apparatus is a variation of the ``parallel band'' device developed by G. I. Taylor. Previous experimental studies on low viscosity ratio, low Reynolds number (Re⪡1) bubble deformation have focussed on either small or large deformations (mostly small deformation) and have only qualitatively examined the orientation of bubbles except for small deformations. Our data set spans both the theoretical small deformation and high deformation limits. With these data we confirm theoretical relationships and assess the range of capillary numbers (Ca) over which theoretical relationships for shape and orientation of bubbles are appropriate. We also examine the geometry of deformed bubbles as they relax to a spherical shape once shear stresses are removed. Our data indicate that for extremely small Reynolds numbers and viscosity ratios, the small deformation theoretical relationship first developed by Taylor, is a good approximation for Ca<0.5. The large deformation results for both shape and bubble orientation derived by Hinch and Acrivos agree with our data for Ca>1 and Ca>0.5, respectively.},

	abstract = {Techniques, such as micropipette aspiration and optical tweezers, are widely used to measure cell mechanical properties, but are generally labor-intensive and time-consuming, typically involving a difficult process of manipulation. In the past two decades, a large number of microfluidic devices have been developed due to the advantages they offer over other techniques, including transparency for direct optical access, lower cost, reduced space and labor, precise control, and easy manipulation of a small volume of blood samples. This review presents recent advances in the development of microfluidic devices to evaluate the mechanical response of individual red blood cells (RBCs) and microbubbles flowing in constriction microchannels. Visualizations and measurements of the deformation of RBCs flowing through hyperbolic, smooth, and sudden-contraction microchannels were evaluated and compared. In particular, we show the potential of using hyperbolic-shaped microchannels to precisely control and assess small changes in RBC deformability in both physiological and pathological situations. Moreover, deformations of air microbubbles and droplets flowing through a microfluidic constriction were also compared with RBCs deformability.},

	abstract = {The coalescence and break-up of bubbles are important steps in many industrial processes. To date, most of the literature has been focussed on the coalescence process which has been studied using high speed cinematographic techniques. However, bubble break-up is equally important and requires further research. This review essentially details the break-up process and initially summarizes the different types of bubble deformation processes which lead to break-up. Break-up is considered in high and low turbulent (pseudo-static) conditions and the effect of fluctuations and shear forces on the break-up is reviewed. Different mechanisms of break-up are discussed including shearing-off, coalescence induced pitching and impact pinching following air entrapment. Also, the influence of bubble size, interfacial stability, and surfactant on break-up are reviewed and a summary of recent experimental techniques presented. Finally, the break-up process which occurs in micro-fluidics is summarized.},

              number is shown to increase for drops more viscous than the medium (viscosity
              ratio λ=0.3) and decreases when the medium is more viscous (λ=1.9) or when
              Reynolds number is increased. A discussion on the accuracy of the numerical
              method and solutions to typical problems are included for comparison. The drop
              interface is reconstructed using the piecewise linear interface calculation
              (PLIC) and transported with the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method, which follows
              unsplit case-by-case schemes based on the basic donating region (BDR) or the
              defined donating region (DDR). Surface tension is included with the
              continuum-surface-force (CSF) model. A high-resolution (SMART) semi-implicit
              finite-volume discretization is employed in the linear momentum equations. Mass
              is conserved by following an implicit pressure-correction method (SIMPLEC). The
              normal vector of the interface is computed from height functions using least
              squares fitting. The advantage of the DDR scheme lies in its volume-conserving
              capabilities which have not been exploited in recent investigations.},

@article{IoaLiuZha16,
	abstract = {This study is to understand confinement effect on the
              dynamical behaviour of a droplet immersed in an immiscible liquid subjected to
              a simple shear flow. The lattice Boltzmann method, which uses a forcing term
              and a recolouring algorithm to realize the interfacial tension effect and phase
              separation respectively, is adopted to systematically study droplet deformation
              and breakup in confined conditions. The effects of capillary number, viscosity
              ratio of the droplet to the carrier liquid, and confinement ratio are studied.
              The simulation results are compared against the theoretical predictions,
              experimental and numerical data available in literature. We find that
              increasing confinement ratio will enhance deformation, and the maximum
              deformation occurs at the viscosity ratio of unity. The droplet is found to
              orient more towards the flow direction with increasing viscosity ratio or
              confinement ratio. Also, it is noticed that the wall effect becomes more
              significant for the confinement ratios larger than 0.4. Finally, the critical
              capillary number, above which the droplet breakup occurs, is found to be mildly
              affected by the confinement for the viscosity ratio of unity. Upon increasing
              the confinement ratio, the critical capillary number increases for the
              viscosity ratios less than unity, but decreases for the viscosity ratios more
              than unity.},

	abstract = {A numerical algorithm for the linear equation of state is
              developed for the volume-of-fluid interface-tracking code SURFER++, using the
              continuous surface stress formulation for the description of interfacial
              tension. This is applied to deformation under simple shear for a liquid drop in
              a much more viscous matrix liquid. We choose a Reynolds number and capillary
              number at which the drop settles to an ellipsoidal steady state, when there is
              no surfactant. The viscosity ratio is selected in a range where experiments
              have shown tip streaming when surfactants are added. Our calculations show that
              surfactant is advected by the flow and moves to the tips of the drop. There is
              a threshhold surfactant level, above which the drop develops pointed tips,
              which are due to surfactant accumulating at the ends of the drop. Fragments
              emitted from these tips are on the scale of the mesh size, pointing to a
              shortcoming of the linear equation of state, namely that it does not provide a
              lower bound on interfacial tension. One outcome is the possibility of an
              unphysical negative surface tension on the emitted drops.},

	abstract = {We present a sharp interface method for computing incompressible immiscible two-phase flows. It couples the level-set and volume-of-fluid techniques and retains their advantages while overcoming their weaknesses. It is stable and robust even for large density and viscosity ratios on the order of 1000 to 1. The numerical method is an extension of the second-order method presented by Sussman [M. Sussman, A second order coupled levelset and volume of fluid method for computing growth and collapse of vapor bubbles, Journal of Computational Physics 187 (2003) 110--136] in which the previous method treated the gas pressure as spatially constant and the present method treats the gas as a second incompressible fluid. The new method yields solutions in the zero gas density limit which are comparable in accuracy to the method in which the gas pressure was treated as spatially constant. This improvement in accuracy allows one to compute accurate solutions on relatively coarse grids, thereby providing a speed-up over continuum or ``ghost-fluid'' methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent advances in the coalescence in liquid foams are reviewed, with a special focus on the multiscale structure of foams. Studies concerning the stability of isolated foam films, on the one hand, and the coalescence process in macroscopic foams, on the other hand, are not always in good agreement. This discrepancy reveals that two routes can induce coalescence in a foam. The first route is thermodynamic and shows that coalescence is governed by a stochastic rupture of foam films. The second route relies on a mechanically induced rupture of the films, due to the spontaneous evolution of foams. From a literature review, the evaluation of the different timescales involved in these mechanisms allows defining the limiting parameters of foam coalescence.},
